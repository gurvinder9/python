## How to Run the Examples

1. **Navigate to the basic folder:**
   ```bash
   cd basic
   ```

2. **Run individual files:**
   ```bash
   python 01_variables_and_types.py
   python 02_input_output.py
   python 03_operators.py
   python 04_control_flow.py
   ```

3. **Or run from the root directory:**
   ```bash
   python basic/01_variables_and_types.py
   python basic/02_input_output.py
   python basic/03_operators.py
   python basic/04_control_flow.py
   python basic/05_loop.py
   python basic/06_dict.py
   python basic/06_dict-method.py
   python basic/07_list.py
   python basic/07_list-method.py
   python basic/08_list-comprehension.py
   python basic/09_dict-comprehension.py
   python basic/10_tuple.py
   python basic/11_sets.py
   ```

## Tips for Learning

- **Run each file**: Execute the code to see the output and understand how it works
- **Modify the examples**: Try changing values and see what happens
- **Practice**: Create your own variations of the examples
- **Read the comments**: Each file contains explanations for better understanding

## Next Steps
