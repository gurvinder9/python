# Python Basics Learning Materials

Welcome to the Python Basics folder! This directory contains learning materials for beginners who want to learn Python programming.

## Learning Sequence

Follow these files in order for a structured learning experience:

### 1. Variables and Data Types (`01_variables_and_types.py`)
- Understanding Python variables
- Data types: strings, integers, floats, booleans
- Type checking
- Variable assignment and constants

### 2. Input and Output (`02_input_output.py`)
- Using `print()` for output
- Using `input()` for user input
- Formatted strings (f-strings)
- Error handling for input conversion

### 3. Operators (`03_operators.py`)
- Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)
- Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
- Logical operators (and, or, not)
- Assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=)
- Identity and membership operators (is, in)

### 4. Control Flow (`04_control_flow.py`)
- If-else statements
- For loops and while loops
- Break and continue statements
- Nested loops
- Pass statement

## How to Run the Examples

1. **Navigate to the basic folder:**
   ```bash
   cd basic
   ```

2. **Run individual files:**
   ```bash
   python 01_variables_and_types.py
   python 02_input_output.py
   python 03_operators.py
   python 04_control_flow.py
   ```

3. **Or run from the root directory:**
   ```bash
   python basic/01_variables_and_types.py
   python basic/02_input_output.py
   python basic/03_operators.py
   python basic/04_control_flow.py
   ```

## Tips for Learning

- **Run each file**: Execute the code to see the output and understand how it works
- **Modify the examples**: Try changing values and see what happens
- **Practice**: Create your own variations of the examples
- **Read the comments**: Each file contains explanations for better understanding
